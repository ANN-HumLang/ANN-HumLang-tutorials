# ANN-HumLang-tutorials
Materials for the tutorials and collaborative tasks at our workshop on Using Artificial Neural Networks for Studying Human Language Learning and Processing (ILLC, 10-12 June 2024)

## Testing the entropy tutorial materials
To ensure you will be able to use the materials for the entropy-based probing tutorial by Henry Conklin, please follow these steps (you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:ANN-HumLang/ANN-HumLang-tutorials.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the entropy directory:
   ```
   cd ANN-HumLang-tutorials/entropy
   ```
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   bash setup.sh
   ```
  This should take you to a jupyterlab environment in your browser, where you will be able to access and run the notebooks.
