# What's in a developmental phase? Training dynamics & Behavioural characterizations of grammar learning

Here you can find the notebook and files needed for exploring the grammar learning trajectories for the Pythia-160m model.
It is recommended to simply use the notebook we have prepared at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uRdl0-pYximdpSeKyL7VbGFcZKqXlWnj?usp=sharing).
However, the notebook should also work locally---though you would have to install the dependencies yourself.

## Running the notebook locally
After cloning this repository, you should be able to open the notebook in, for example, VS Code. For installing the dependencies, you can create a virtual env (on linux/mac) using:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
